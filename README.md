# TrueImageAI
This repository contains the code and resources for a deep learning model designed to discriminate between real and AI-generated images. The model utilizes ResNet, Xception, and MobileNet architectures implemented with PyTorch, trained on a dataset of 10,000 facial images. The goal of this project is to create a robust system capable of distinguishing between real and AI-generated images with high accuracy. This is achieved by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models and extensive training data.

### Key Achievements
